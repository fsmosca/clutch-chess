# Clutch Chess
Clutch Chess: The Legends was a special chess960 exhibition event held from October 8–10, 2025, at the newly reopened Saint Louis Chess Club.

It featured a historic rematch between former world champions Garry Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand, marking 30 years since their 1995 World Championship battle.

The match was played in the Chess960 (Fischer Random) format to encourage creativity and reduce opening preparation. It spanned 12 games — six rapid (25 minutes + 10-second increment) and six blitz (5 minutes + 3-second increment) — spread across three days.
